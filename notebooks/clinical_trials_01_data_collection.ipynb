    "# Predictive Analysis on Clinical Trial Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Investigator\n",
    "- [Nicholas S. McBride, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nsmcbride/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objective\n",
    "This project aims to develop predictive models to analyze clinical trial outcomes based on the study design and implementation details available before any results are published. Leveraging data from [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/), the goal is to forecast the trajectory of clinical trials, which is invaluable in the Biotechnology industry for risk assessment, resource allocation, and strategic decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 1: Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources\n",
    "Data is sourced through the [ClinicalTrials.gov API](https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-api/api), which provides a comprehensive database of clinical studies. The information structure and query syntax used in this project are guided by the [API documentation](https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-api/api) and [ESSIE query syntax](https://clinicaltrials.gov/find-studies/constructing-complex-search-queries), which was [developed specifically for the ClinicalTrials.gov project at the NLM](https://doi.org/10.1197/jamia.M2233) for in silico biomedical literature research.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) Reference Links\n",
    "\n",
    "- [API documentation](https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-api/api)\n",
    "- [Data structure](https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-api/about-api/study-data-structure)\n",
    "- [ESSIE query syntax](https://clinicaltrials.gov/find-studies/constructing-complex-search-queries)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inclusion Criteria\n",
    "The scope is confined to clinical studies categorized under specific recruitment and expanded access statuses. Clincial studies with overall status indicating a terminal success or failure were selected. Studies with overall status indicating active or in recruitment status were excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Study Overall Status Definitions](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study-basics/glossary)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Recruitment status | Description |\n",
    "|-|-|\n",
    "| Not yet recruiting | The study has not started recruiting participants. |\n",
    "| Recruiting | The study is currently recruiting participants. |\n",
    "| Enrolling by invitation | The study is selecting its participants from a population decided on by the researchers in advance. These studies are not open to everyone who meets the eligibility criteria but only to people in that particular population, who are specifically invited to participate. |\n",
    "| Active, not recruiting | The study is ongoing, and participants are receiving an intervention or being examined, but potential participants are not currently being recruited or enrolled. |\n",
    "| Suspended | The study has stopped early but may start again. |\n",
    "| Terminated | The study has stopped early and will not start again. Participants are no longer being examined or treated. |\n",
    "| Completed | The study has ended normally, and participants are no longer being examined or treated (that is, the last participant's last visit has occurred). |\n",
    "| Withdrawn | The study stopped early, before enrolling its first participant. |\n",
    "| Unknown | A study on ClinicalTrials.gov whose last known status was recruiting; not yet recruiting; or active, not recruiting but that has passed its completion date, and the status has not been last verified within the past 2 years. |\n",
    "\n",
    "| Expanded access status | Description |\n",
    "|-|-|\n",
    "| Available | Expanded access is currently available for this investigational treatment, and patients who are not participants in the clinical study may be able to gain access to the drug, biologic, or medical device being studied. |\n",
    "| No longer available | Expanded access was available for this intervention previously but is not currently available and will not be available in the future. |\n",
    "| Temporarily not available| Expanded access is not currently available for this intervention but is expected to be available in the future. |\n",
    "| Approved for marketing | The intervention has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use by the public. |\n",
    "\n",
    "Based in this information. The scope was limited to studies with overall statuses:\n",
    "- Suspended\n",
    "- Terminated\n",
    "- Completed\n",
    "- Withdrawn\n",
    "- Unknown\n",

    "- No longer available\n",
    "- Temporarily not available\n",
    "- Approved for marketing\n",
    "\n",
    "Examination of the API data revealed an additional undocumented status 'Withheld' encompassing 880 studies in the ClinicalTrials.gov database. Withheld studies contained little data and most information was redacted. These studies were excluded due to insufficient data. Further documentation reveals that \"Withheld studies are a special case where a FDA-regulated device product is not yet approved or cleared by U.S. FDA\"."
